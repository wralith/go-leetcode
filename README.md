# Go Leetcode

There are solution and the test on each folder inside leedcode directory.

Thinking about algorithm, implementing data structure to them help me learn new programming languages this repository might be useful for you if you think like me as well.

Most of the time i think about the problem for few minutes, try to define it well, visualize, bring up with some alternative solutions. Then again, most of the time i search for the optimal solution and repo mostly consists of those. Because, there would be no _learning_ without _input_

I love [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) packages approach on testing go so i used it most of my tests.
